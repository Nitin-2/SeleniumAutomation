// Abstraction can be achieved through Abstract Class and Interface.

//If a method is Abstract class should also have Abstract keyword.
//Abstract Class can have Abstract Method and Non Abstract Method.
//Abstract method have no Body.
// An Abstract Method will always have an Abstract Class but An Abstract Class either Can have an Abstract method or Non Abstract Method.
