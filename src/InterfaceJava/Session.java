//  what is an Interface :- Method without Body.- completed (void Eat ();)
//It will only have Abstract method wont come normal method (We are not going to use Abstract keyword- Reason
// Reason bcoz if we make method Abstract we have to make Class Abstract

// When you are Inheriting particular method in interface ,method inside the interface has to be implemented in the child class.
